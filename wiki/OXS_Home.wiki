==Introduction==

!OpenXsensor is the evolution of [https://code.google.com/p/openxvario/ OpenXvario] and extends it to multi-sensing applications.

Discussion about this project: http://openrcforums.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=86

Based on an [http://arduino.cc/ Arduino] platform, it connects to different sensors and transmits the measurements via !FrSky telemetry capabilities.

It is both compatible with the *D series* receivers (HUB protocol) and the new *X series* rx (Smart Port protocol).

==Functionalities provided at your choice :==

  * Altimeter / Variometer _(like !FrSky Variometer sensor high precision)_
  * Up to 6 voltages measurements
    * Battery voltage measurements _(like !FrSky FBVS-01)_
    * Lipo battery cell measurements _(like !FrSky FLVS-01 or FLVSS)_
    * ...
  * RPM sensor
  * Current sensor _(like !FrSky FAS or FCS)_
    * Can calculate the consumed current
  * Can use any sensor outputting voltage
    * Temperature sensor
    * ...
